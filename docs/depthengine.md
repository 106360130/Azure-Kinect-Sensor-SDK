# Depth Engine

The Azure Kinect Sensor SDK open source component does not include the depth engine which
converts raw sensor data in to a normalized depth map.

This component is specific to the sensor in the Azure Kinect DK hardware.

The depth engine is not licensed under MIT as it contains propriety code which is why it
is not included in the Azure Kinect Sensor SDK project directly.

## Obtaining the Depth Engine

The depth engine is distributed as part of all Azure Kinect Sensor SDK binary releases.
If you are building the sensor SDK from source, you will need to obtain a copy from a binary
release to read data from a device.
