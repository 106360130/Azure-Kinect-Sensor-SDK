This sample demonstrates code patterns with the existing K4A API to achieve more complex calls. For example 
get_most_recent_capture() shows to discard all information in the data pipeline, without blocking to get the freshest 
and most recent sample.

These code snipits are not meant to run directly, as they only capture a small fraction of the code needed to process a
sample.
