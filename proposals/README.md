# Azure Kinect Sensor SDK Proposals

New features proposals are living documents describing the current thinking about a given feature. Proposals are the way for Azure Kinect team  to communicate to the public upcoming new feature work and get the feedback.
At this time, all proposals will be created by Microsoft Azure Kinect team for the most desired features, but if you have a great idea for a proposal, please submit it on [User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/920053).

We would love your feedback on every proposal and therefore we will create a GitHub issue where you can prove it.
